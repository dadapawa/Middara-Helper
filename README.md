More options are available (you can flip all cards there, or add special tokens such as Stupefy or share a card with the other players).

It is also possible to "remove" the card (It will show "Removed" and add no bonus).

An option is also there to send or gain tokens quickly if the card refers to that token. Choosing to send an Intervention will display the list of all the connected players and current allies (command). Same for negative effects and enemies.

Long pressing a card will zoom it and show rules info regarding that card.

All combatant info (tokens, HP etc.) is shared between all connected players.

Pressing the small icon on the top right will show you all of the options regarding this section.

When you kill a combatant, a reminder for Combat loot will pop up, when applicable.

Pressing the image in cases where the combatant or command can send tokens will give you a list of potential targets.

In the case of a Command or Esper, a bottom bar similar to your Adventurer bar will be displayed. It allows you to handle tokens, stamina, stats and refresh. The main display's image is divided, allowing you to press and long press single abilities.
<img width="600" height="270" alt="esper" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9c2c783-a210-4d45-90de-e0a056372b9a" />

## Books

In the top left, 3 options are present: Rules, Adventure and Mission.

<img width="600" height="270" alt="missionrules" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c70edf51-01e5-46c1-873a-52ca113e7680" />

**Rules** allows you to display most rules found in the books. A filter can be used to quickly search the name or text of the rules.

The gear option allows you to change the text size.

<img width="600" height="270" alt="missionadventure" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3322f3d-8291-4d73-aabd-119069ee8f3f" />

# Management Screen

**Gear icon:** Has the same options as in the Mission screen.

**Card icon:** Similar to the Mission screen, except the **Draw Unique** option is replaced by **Draw Unique (Shop)**, which allows you to draw unique items to add to the shop.

There is also an option to look at the Familiar cards there.

## Equipped
<img width="600" height="270" alt="manageequiped" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/953917cc-44a8-4241-8ac8-894e0cbb0533" />

Here you can unequip items. There is also an option to upgrade an item to a higher tier (Custom rules, check below for more info. This can be disabled).

## Carried
<img width="600" height="270" alt="managecarried" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b0cf970-3400-40a2-8f0c-6c179a37fe1d" />

Here you can unequip carried items and items in your pack.

## Stash
<img width="600" height="270" alt="managementstash" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6342567b-71bb-4686-9cad-790cbdd1ffb7" />

Here you see all your items and stashed items from other players. You can sell or equip your item, or request an item from another player. The name on an item specifies who has it in their stash. The name color defines if the player is connected (green) or not (red).

The different icons on the left allow you to filter items by type (All, Weapons, Armors, Core, Accessories, Relics and Consumables).

## Shop
<img width="600" height="270" alt="manageshop" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79dae14b-c4eb-4590-8a7f-9a6e55e97751" />

Every game starts at the Item Tier Mundane (MU). You can press the greyed out "CO" to increase your item tier to Common. Then the next available tier will be displayed greyed out (UN for Uncommon). You can switch back to old tiers by pressing the MU button.

The different icons on the left allow you to filter items by type (All, Weapons, Armors, Core, Accessories, Relics and Consumables).

For Consumables, all the items from previous tiers are displayed (ordered by tier).

You can then press any card to buy it.

### Upgrades
<img width="600" height="270" alt="manageupgrade" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6b179d8-fb10-495c-87a0-cbee3d5a797b" />

At the bottom of the item tier buttons, there is a stone icon. This is for Item Upgrades. They are all locked by default and can be unlocked with a Monster loot material. You can unlock them and attach them to any equipped item.

More upgrades can be displayed by revealing their Hidden cards and "unlocking" them (like for Cave Sickle Queen's Bounty).

## Discipline
<img width="600" height="270" alt="managediscipline" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be4e30d6-d545-41b7-9512-46dd708f21eb" />

You can refund your discipline and hide it from the mission screen (useful for disciplines that are pure passive stat bonuses that have no interactive use).

The '+' Card allows you to bring up the discipline decks. You are able to view later level disciplines but can't take any unless you have the requirements (1 level 1 card for level 2, a level 2 for level 3 etc.) and the price scales automatically as per the rules.

### Ubiquitous and Linked cards

These will define if you are in a 3 or 2 player variant game. Each player must add them. In case a card is "removed" as per the variant game, you can press the discipline and "Remove" the card temporarily (it will remove all related bonuses, but still tag you in a 2/3 player variant).

---

# Options Screen

Here you can change some options for the app.

## Display Discipline

Base setting is to show the disciplines with your equipped items. You can change it so it shows on its own subscreen.

You can also change the size of the disciplines.

## Unlocks

You can remove "Unlocks" (Drawn hidden cards) that you drew by mistake.

## Automation

### Effect token

Here you can disable the effect of Tokens during the refresh phase (like Poison or Condemn).

### Other Effects

This allows triggers during the refresh phase such as disciplines that gain energy or items that give certain tokens.

### End of next turn effect

This allows some triggers that apply at the end of the next turn. This is a workaround as it applies at the start of the refresh phase and not at the end of the next turn. Only a few things trigger here (Musket for example).

## QOL (Quality of Life)

### Text size

Allows you to change the text size of rules and sparknotes.

### Autoswap musket

This brings up a popup when you use a Musket item (which allows a free re-equip) to swap your equipped musket or flintlock with another musket or flintlock, or a set of items.

### Auto unflip Musket

This will add a counter to know since when the item was flipped, and unflip it after 2 refresh phases. *Normally, the unflip happens at the end of the 2nd turn, but in the app, it will happen after 2 refreshes (so a bit later). Nothing stops you from unflipping it after your 2nd end of turn if you need it, like for a counter attack.

### Display token menu

Quick menu is displayed once a token has been added. The full menu is the one with all the tokens and is displayed from the quick menu when you press Manage.

## Connection

Here you can change your connection settings or your player displayed name.

## House rules

### Side content

I added things from the side campaign here, such as story items and some enemies as variants (Like Coral Loa for Water Loa). The items are added as uniques or normal items depending on their strength, and the images have been modified to be transparent (as in, it won't show as a Story item). If you long press such an item, an "(Alternate)" will be next to the item type.

### Allow Tier Upgrades

Some low tier items have cool abilities that are not seen later, and sometimes, an item of the next tier feels like a downgrade (except for the dice).

This allows you to upgrade an item to the higher tier at the cost of what the next tier item would cost. This scales some stats (health, defense, force X (WIP)) and the Dice of the item. If upgrades are attached to the item, the price of the upgrades for the next tier is also added.

### Reduce Back To School Wandering Quantity

Back to School added a few items that have 4 copies. This dilutes the deck quite a bit, so I added this. It will make it so a single copy is present, but once added, it can be bought by everyone.

### Debug

This should not be touched, as it is used when testing the app.

# Log Screen
<img width="600" height="270" alt="log" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dc1a9c2-8c9c-4ed7-b07f-3b8dfb47ec34" />

This screen displays the logs. It can be used to track what happened in case you are unsure or misclicked and want to confirm. It also displays any errors the application encountered. There are filters at the top to display only certain kinds of logs.
